/***********************************************************************
* Program:
*    Assignment 32, comparing arrays
*    Brother Cook, cs124
* Author:
*    Benjamin Moffett
* Summary: 
*   I want my program to prompt the user for a letter than a phrase then
*       I want my program to compare the two and tell the user how many
*       times the letter appears in the phrase.
*
*    Estimated:  0.5 hrs   
*    Actual:     1 hrs
*      At first my program wasn't allowing me to input both the letter
*       and phrase then I realized I needed to use the cin.getline
*       command comparred to the just cin >> command.
