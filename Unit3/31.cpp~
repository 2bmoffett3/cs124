/***********************************************************************
* Program:
*    Assignment 30, Array
*    Brother Cook, CS 124
* Author:
*    Benjamin Moffett
* Summary: 
*       I want my program to run an array that will store ten grades which
*       are inputted by the user than I want to display back to the user
*       the average grade of the ten which were put in.
*
*    Estimated:  .25 hrs   
*    Actual:     0.5 hrs
*      Hardest part was recognizing there is a difference between char[]
*       and int[]. I didn't see that explained in the book even after
*       reading the chapter several times. Then I recognized there was
*       an int[] and decided to give it a try, and it worked!
